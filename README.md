ITCS 6166 Project 1: Socket Programming Multi-user Chat
Overview:
In this project I have developed a Multi-user Chat Room using the client-server model. This is
achieved through creating multithreaded classes and sockets. Users are able to login with a
name of their choosing. Then they are able to send messages to each other. Users are able to
leave and re enter the chat room without any issues. Lastly the chat room text is stored in a text
file, allowing the retrieval of previous conversations if the server needs to restart
